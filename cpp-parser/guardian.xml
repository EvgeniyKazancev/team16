      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/bobby-charlton-funeral-manchester-united-mourners</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thousands of mourners lined the route from Old Trafford football stadium to Manchester cathedral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some footballers are remembered for their individual success. Others are forever linked to a team. Vanishingly few symbolise what one fan described on Monday as “the passing of an era before our eyes”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Sir Bobby Charlton left Old Trafford for the final time, his funeral cortege carried by a ripple of applause, thousands of mourners bade farewell to a titan of the game, revered as much for his impeccable character as his talent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/bobby-charlton-funeral-manchester-united-mourners"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

The project focussed on a biomass power plant in Xinjiang, China, which said it would lower global carbon emissions by using waste cotton stalks from nearby fields to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/13/carbon-credits-at-risk-of-link-to-uyghur-forced-labour-bought-by-bp-and-spotify"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drivers of two HGVs carrying high-end Moët &amp;amp; Chandon manage to flee but officers recover stolen bubbly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French police are looking for a gang of champagne thieves after a high-speed motorway chase in which two heavy goods vehicles carrying a total of €600,000 (£436,000) worth of stolen prestige bottles sped through northern France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two trailers containing high-end champagne by Moët &amp;amp; Chandon disappeared in the early hours of Saturday morning in Reims, the capital of the Champagne region, according to reports in Le Parisien and on local TV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/french-police-foil-600000-champagne-theft-after-high-speed-chase"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Battle for al-Shifa hospital in Gaza fraught with diplomatic risk for Israel</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/control-of-al-shifa-hospital-in-gaza-is-a-key-israeli-military-and-political-aim</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Israel justifies attacks saying they are on Hamas bunkers and infrastructure in the area but the assault comes with diplomatic risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/11/israel-hamas-war-live-staff-report-catastrophic-situation-in-main-gaza-hospital-aid-agency-says-as-fighting-intensifies"&gt;Israel-Hamas war – live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establishing control over al-Shifa hospital is a key Israeli objective for military and political reasons. The sprawling complex dominates the centre of Gaza City, where Hamas has much of its administrative infrastructure, and is close to the main north-south road that runs along the coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Destroying the ability of Hamas to govern Gaza is one of the stated aims of the Israeli offensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/control-of-al-shifa-hospital-in-gaza-is-a-key-israeli-military-and-political-aim"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We feel safe here’: Cyprus becomes ‘haven’ after Hamas attack</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/cyprus-becomes-safe-haven-after-hamas-attack-israel-middle-east</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Israelis flee to island only a 40-minute flight away that looks set to play critical geopolitical role amid Middle East unrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In quieter times, the four-storey building that houses the Jewish community centre in the heart of Larnaca is an oasis of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If visitors drop by, it is usually to pray, enjoy the centre’s kosher food, or learn more about the &lt;a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/cyprus-detention-camps"&gt;British-run detention camps&lt;/a&gt; in which over 53,000 Holocaust survivors were interned on Cyprus between 1946 and early 1949, when the last 10,000 were evacuated to the new Israeli state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/cyprus-becomes-safe-haven-after-hamas-attack-israel-middle-east"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘This was her heaven’: son returns to Israel kibbutz where his mother was abducted</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WARNING: This article contains images that some readers may find distressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noam Sagi wants information on what happened to Ada, 75, during the 7 October Hamas attack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a ghost town,” said Noam Sagi as he returned to the Nir Oz kibbutz for the first time since his mother, Ada, 75, was abducted by Hamas gunmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had arrived from London to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/they-had-no-chance-uk-relatives-of-missing-israelis-pray-for-their-release"&gt;continue campaigning for the release of the 240 hostages&lt;/a&gt; who were snatched from their homes on 7 October, but he also wanted to make sense of what happened to Ada, who last messaged her family at 9.24am on what some in Israel now refer to as “Black Saturday”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/this-was-her-haven-son-returns-to-israel-kibbutz-where-his-mother-was-abducted"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A painter, a poet, a novelist: the artists being killed in Gaza</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The territory’s vibrant arts community was testament to Palestinian resilience, but now it is losing voices central to its spirit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her vibrant paintings of Jerusalem’s holy sites and Palestinian women wearing traditional embroidered dresses were a way to send a message to the “outside world”, the Palestinian artist Heba Zagout said in a video about her work posted online in late September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, the 39-year-old was killed with two of her children, Adam and Mahmoud, in an Israeli air strike. Her husband and two other children survived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/a-painter-a-poet-a-novelist-the-artists-being-killed-in-gaza"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rats, rotten cupboards and collapsed ceilings in a north-east England rental flat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Housing officers say Peter Thompson’s flat, where the walls are wet with damp,  is one of the worst they’ve ever seen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is rare these days for housing officers to be lost for words. But on an inspection of a rented flat in north-east England this month, one experienced officer struggled to articulate her disgust – not at the state of the property, but at the obvious dereliction of its landlord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incredulous,” she says, when she finally finds the right word. “Like, how dare they take rent [for this]?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/13/rats-rotten-cupboards-collapsed-ceilings-north-east-england-rental-flat"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How the UK far right hijacked Armistice Day | Archie Bland</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/nov/13/how-the-far-right-hijacked-armistice-day</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Police and on-the-ground accounts suggest violence came largely from counterprotesters rather than those on Palestine march&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article is extracted from our First Edition newsletter.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the UK government’s reaction to disorder in London on Armistice Day, as well as some media coverage, have suggested that blame was shared equally between those on the pro-Palestinian march of at least 300,000 people and those who joined the much smaller, far-right counterprotest. But on-the-ground reporting, footage of events, and police accounts from the weekend suggest that this is misleading, and that the significant trouble that unfolded was largely the responsibility of the far right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a summary of the claims and the evidence so far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/nov/13/how-the-far-right-hijacked-armistice-day"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/what-do-we-know-about-forced-labour-in-xinjiang</link>

The facilities are referred to by Beijing as vocational education and training centres. But critics say they are used to indoctrinate Uyghurs and other minority ethnic groups with the goal of transforming them into devotees of the Chinese Communist party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After unrest in the region and a series of riots and violent attacks by Uyghur separatists between 2014 to 2017, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, launched his Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html"&gt;leading to&lt;/a&gt; the establishment of the camps.

      <title>Wigs, kisses and the pope’s jumpsuit: can Maestro reveal the real Bernstein?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/13/maestro-leonard-bernstein-bradley-cooper-pope</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bradley Cooper has audiences in raptures as electrifying conductor Leonard Bernstein in a new authorised biopic. Musicians from the London Symphony Orchestra remember playing for the great man – and rate the man who now plays him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera, like its subject, is hyperactive in Maestro. It swoops and pirouettes. It drops into the middle of frantic conversations, with barely a pause for breath as Bradley Cooper charms and dazzles as Leonard Bernstein. This is Lenny in his 1950s and 60s heyday, building a life with Felicia, played by Carey Mulligan. He is prodigious in both talent and appetite, a man of restless contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What there is very little of is music. We barely see him conduct, we hear only snatches of his own compositions, and there are frustratingly few glimpses of his passion for communicating – through performance and education – the wonders and riches of classical music. Which is why one lengthy sequence near the end of Maestro is so powerful. When we do finally see him conduct, leading a performance of Mahler’s Second Symphony in Ely Cathedral, Cambridgeshire, Cooper shows us how Bernstein becomes the music, and the music becomes him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/13/maestro-leonard-bernstein-bradley-cooper-pope"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I’m still friends with the person who applied my pubic wig’: how we made Cold Feet</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/13/how-we-made-cold-feet-pubic-wig</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘A lot of it was autobiographical. When Adam won Rachel back by serenading her with a red rose up his bottom, that was based on me – with a bit of artistic licence’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a show about relationships based on me and my friends. Apart from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/04/people-say-its-the-reason-they-became-a-lawyer-the-stars-of-this-life-on-their-era-defining-show"&gt;This Life&lt;/a&gt;, our generation never saw our lives depicted on TV. All the shows we loved were American, like thirtysomething and Ally McBeal. We aspired to something that looked cinematic and not traditionally British.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/13/how-we-made-cold-feet-pubic-wig"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘People’s idea of Irishness is so warped’: John Francis Flynn, the folk singer fighting for Dublin’s spirit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having started out playing a twee take on Irish music on a cruise ship, Flynn is determined to fight stereotypes with music that confronts the truth of the capitalist forces ravaging his home city&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2016, John Francis Flynn was booked for a lucrative residency on a Disney cruise ship, performing with a band at an imitation Irish pub themed on the leprechaun-heavy 1959 film Darby O’Gill and the Little People. “You’d be down getting breakfast next to some fella dressed as Goofy. It was really quite torturous,” he laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when the promoters suggested the band dress as the film’s characters and play songs like Ed Sheeran’s much-mocked &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/may/05/ed-sheeran-saoirse-ronan-galway-girl-song-video-irish-doritos"&gt;version of Galway Girl&lt;/a&gt;, the band turned down the offer to return. “People’s idea of Irishness is so warped,” Flynn says. “We’re proud of our culture and we like to share that with people, but you’re fighting a losing battle when people don’t care unless you’re wearing green or drinking a pint.” It’s something he sees in his native Dublin too. “Temple Bar is like Disneyland,” he says, referring to the riverside neighbourhood in the city centre beloved by tourists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/13/peoples-idea-of-irishness-is-so-warped-john-francis-flynn-the-folk-singer-fighting-for-dublins-spirit"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Any embarrassment is in your head!’: How hearing aids boost your health and happiness</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/any-embarrassment-is-in-your-head-how-hearing-aids-boost-your-health-and-happiness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is still a stigma around hearing tests and hearing loss – even though excellent help is now at hand. It could just change your life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Mosley has spent decades trying to help us all to eat healthily, sleep better and do more exercise. Now the broadcaster, author and former doctor is turning his attention to our ears, encouraging anyone who has noticed a change in their hearing to take a free test. “Hearing change is completely normal and is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about,” he stresses. He should know: &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42620387" title=""&gt;Mosley has been experiencing hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; for several years. “At 66, my hearing’s not great,” he tells me over the phone. “I really struggle in social settings such as pubs and restaurants.” I assume he wears hearing aids these days. “I’m not quite ready for a hearing aid yet!” he protests. “My hearing’s not bad enough. I’ll go back in a year or so for another test.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might make Mosley an odd choice to front Specsavers’ hearing-test campaign – but his attitude reflects a society-wide reluctance to wearing hearing aids. And at least he has actually taken a hearing test. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17927921/" title=""&gt;A much-cited 2007 study&lt;/a&gt; showed that, on average, it takes people 10 years from noticing hearing loss to getting it checked out. Ten years later, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30085938/" title=""&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found the situation has only slightly improved: that figure is now 8.9 years. And Specsavers’ survey of 2,000 UK adults in September found that one in three Britons had noticed changes in their hearing over the past decade but more than half (57%) had taken no action. Reasons given include embarrassment, not feeling it was needed, being too busy and because no one else they know gets their hearing checked. My boyfriend is one of them – he has been struggling to follow conversations in noisy pubs for the past few years, but feels the problem isn’t bad enough to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/any-embarrassment-is-in-your-head-how-hearing-aids-boost-your-health-and-happiness"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The big idea: what my grandmother’s lipstick taught me about the past</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/13/the-big-idea-what-my-grandmothers-lipstick-taught-me-about-the-past</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;History isn’t just battles and monuments, everyday objects can tell us so much about previous eras and their changing moods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my French grandmother died a few years ago, I holed myself up in her bathroom. I took one of her many lipsticks from the makeup cabinet, studied its half-used red nub, and found myself instantly transported back in time. Back to all the mornings on which I stood next to her, wide-eyed and wondering, as she applied the colour to her narrow lips. I thought of her, but also of her friends, her neighbours, the French women of her generation. Of a particular idea of womanhood. At that time, few women left the house without lipstick; for them, it was a question of attitude and respect. A way of inserting themselves into the ranks of “decent women”, who considered it one of their primary tasks to look beautiful and neat. Those little tubes of metal, black plastic and mother-of-pearl didn’t just say something about one woman – my grandmother – but testified immediately, wordlessly, to what it meant to be a middle-class woman in France in the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History can be narrated in so many ways. We can write of battles, wars and conquests, of treaties that drew new borders and economic developments that changed the balance of the world. We can describe history as a succession of unique, extraordinary events involving unique, extraordinary people and, in so doing, narrate it almost exclusively through the powerful, the victors and – let’s be honest – the men. With some exceptions, this is mainly what we do. We learn names and facts by heart, make pilgrimages to monuments, convey our past in a way that makes it seem just as stiff and cold – just as dead, almost – as the materials chosen to embody it. We keep the past and the people who lived in it, who dreamed, laughed, suffered, hoped and loved at a strangely abstract remove.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/13/the-big-idea-what-my-grandmothers-lipstick-taught-me-about-the-past"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The pet I’ll never forget: Queenie, the mysterious budgie who beguiled us all</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/the-pet-ill-never-forget-queenie-the-mysterious-budgie-who-beguiled-us-all</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout her life, she surprised and entertained us – the perfect companion whether at home or on holiday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Shut up, Queenie!” was something you would have regularly heard me bellow, had you happened to be in the vicinity of my living room in the late 1980s. It’s not that our pet budgerigar’s uncanny imitations of household sounds weren’t utterly delightful: the trill of our rotary dial telephone, the dog barking, my sister and I calling our mum in moany, demanding tones. It’s just that Queenie neither knew, nor cared, that you were trying to watch Neighbours or concentrate on a crucial Monopoly tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queenie was a girl, we were told when we bought her, because the nostril area above the beak, called the cere, was pale pink. But after a year or so, this went blue, which meant she was a boy. This only added to her magic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/the-pet-ill-never-forget-queenie-the-mysterious-budgie-who-beguiled-us-all"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Five charts explaining the state of the UK’s rental sector</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/13/five-charts-explain-state-uk-rental-sector</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Britain’s rent crisis in numbers, measuring the increasing pressures on tenants over the past few years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now more tenants than ever; one in five of us in England and Wales is now a member of “generation rent”. The sector has never been more relevant, but its problems have also never been more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renters are handing over increasingly unsustainable portions of their pay in order to live in insecure tenancies, often in dangerous properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/13/five-charts-explain-state-uk-rental-sector"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Suella Braverman is sunk, and so are the Tories: a party of nihilists, led by a loser | Polly Toynbee</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-tory-party-home-secretary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former home secretary is a dangerous loudmouth, but she speaks for a party that has been marching rightwards for years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The home secretary, queen of the anti-woke, is gone, again. Her grandstanding infuriated many colleagues, yet most of them share the same sinking life-raft of current Tory thinking. “I wouldn’t use her words,” each minister says, but they share her thoughts. Reshuffle from what to what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tide is going out on the conservatism they were bred on, the last ripples of Thatcherism that nurtured them leaving them all marooned on an extremist island. Suella Braverman’s backers, such as the Daily Mail, Telegraph and Sun, which20 years ago seemed to have a direct line to the beating heart of Tory middle England, are now adrift. And there is no sign that sacking her and reviving the Greensill-tarnished David Cameron will help: austerity’s author arrives to great public alarm as his policy crushes public services. Only &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Savanta_UK/status/1724000345087455615?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;24% of voters&lt;/a&gt; feel favourably towards him, with nearly twice as many against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-tory-party-home-secretary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nigel Farage is deeply divisive. Why is his reputation being fun-washed on I’m a Celebrity? | Zoe Williams</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/nigel-farage-appearance-on-im-a-celebrity-will-entrench-his-jolly-nice-man-facade-ever-further</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The reality TV show has a redemptive effect on even the most sullied character. Like Matt Hancock, Farage is almost guaranteed his rehabilitation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody has to watch Nigel Farage on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Thousands of you, I bet, have already made the decision not to and will have no trouble sticking to it. But the damage has already been done. Because I know that Farage, whenever he appears on anything, manages to fun-wash himself in some obscure way – he is not, after all, that fun, even when he is not blowing his poundshop dog-whistles. And I know that I’m a Celebrity, more than any other reality TV show, has a redemptive effect on even the most sullied reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first noticed this with Farage years ago, appearing with him on a now defunct radio show, Pienaar’s Politics. It was 2010, and everyone was hail-fellowing Farage because he had just survived a plane crash. He had been flying around Oxfordshire, with the banner “Vote for your country: Vote Ukip”. Back then, Farage’s shtick was mainly maverick/troublemaker. He had been a prominent Eurosceptic for nearly 20 years, was a founder member of Ukip and was the party’s leader for a time, but in those days Ukip was still saying the quiet parts quite quietly: he’d make vague noises about where the real people of the UK stood on immigration, for instance, but he didn’t start talking about a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/12/nigel-farage-british-muslim-fifth-column-fuels-immigration-fear-ukip"&gt;fifth column of Islamic extremists&lt;/a&gt; until later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/nigel-farage-appearance-on-im-a-celebrity-will-entrench-his-jolly-nice-man-facade-ever-further"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>To understand Israel-Palestine, first understand the history of racism and antisemitism | Rachel Shabi</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/israel-palestine-racism-antisemitism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anti-Jewish hate is rarely seen as part of a European racism that encompassed colonialism and slavery, with each distinct prejudice influencing the other&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, hundreds of thousands took part in a history-making march for Gaza, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/suella-braverman-accuses-police-of-double-standards-on-rallies"&gt;hate mobs&lt;/a&gt; imagined by the now former home secretary Suella Braverman turned out to be the far right, who clashed with police. It’s true that the Palestine solidarity march did contain a fringe of hateful messages, but to portray these as characteristic of the whole is absurd. Protesters &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2023/nov/11/thousands-march-in-london-at-pro-palestinian-rally-in-pictures"&gt;called for a halt to the death&lt;/a&gt;, catastrophe and terror being inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/11/macron-calls-for-end-to-killing-of-civilians-in-gaza-as-international-pressure-on-israel-grows"&gt;Demands for a ceasefire&lt;/a&gt; are accelerating globally, as &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/what-do-we-know-about-the-number-of-palestinians-killed-in-gaza-13006290"&gt;about 11,000&lt;/a&gt; people have been killed in the sealed Gaza Strip, including over 4,000 children – and with thousands more injured or orphaned. The Palestinian cause is close to the hearts of leftists, but polling shows it goes wider than that: most of the British public &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2023/10/19/e363e/1"&gt;support a ceasefire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s demonstration contained a sizeable Jewish bloc, who marched despite alarmist warnings across our politics and media that the protests were hotbeds of antisemitism. Jewish people (me included) attend Gaza solidarity marches for many reasons. But I would bet that none include giving free passes on antisemitism to leftists – and neither should a Jewish presence be used to discount the existence of any such prejudice at these protests. More likely, we understand that while this ancient hatred can appear anywhere, it is not the fault of Palestinians that Christian Europe has a long, lingering and largely unacknowledged problem with antisemitism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/israel-palestine-racism-antisemitism"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>When the solution to your problem is David Cameron, you know you’re in deep trouble | Simon Jenkins</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/david-cameron-cabinet-suella-braverman-rishi-sunak</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former PM is back in the cabinet after Suella Braverman’s sacking. It goes to show how few options Rishi Sunak has left&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good riddance. Suella Braverman should never have been home secretary. She was appointed by Liz Truss and then Rishi Sunak for two bad reasons. One was in return for her support in their leadership campaigns. The other was to have a rightwing voice in the cabinet. Braverman has been sacked not for pressuring a senior police chief to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/suella-braverman-accuses-police-of-double-standards-on-rallies"&gt;cancel a protest&lt;/a&gt;. She has gone for infuriating Sunak by writing a newspaper article about it. This is no way to run the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing unusual in a prime minister seeking to balance party factions in a cabinet. But the test should not be loyalty, but fitness for office. Boris Johnson disregarded that in 2019 when he &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet"&gt;dismissed from the cabinet&lt;/a&gt; able ministers from Theresa May’s reign and replaced them with second-raters. Sunak failed to correct that mistake and has been punished for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/david-cameron-cabinet-suella-braverman-rishi-sunak"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/palestinians-world-israel-carnage-gaza</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Palestinian viewpoint is credible and vital as Israel continues to unleash carnage on Gaza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these past few sleepless weeks, I have seen images and videos that will haunt me forever. Palestinian parents carrying their children’s charred and dismembered bodies in plastic bags to makeshift morgues; whole families, across three generations, crushed under the homes they built; exhausted doctors working desperately &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/gaza-hospital-aid-fuel-israel-b2433634.html"&gt;by torchlight&lt;/a&gt; and operating on patients without anaesthetic; one of the &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/10/20/we-were-baptised-here-and-we-will-die-here-gazas-oldest-church-bombed"&gt;oldest churches in the world&lt;/a&gt;, sheltering the displaced, bombed. So far more than &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/06/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-jordan-airdrops-medical-supplies-gaza-blinken-turkey-push-contain-conflict?page=with:block-6548e25f8f08293ffae54177#block-6548e25f8f08293ffae54177"&gt;10,000 Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; have been reported killed – more, after one month, than the number of civilians killed in Ukraine after two years of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli war machine is always horrifically ruthless. But this time we are witnessing a level of violence not seen since &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/5/23/the-nakba-did-not-start-or-end-in-1948"&gt;the 1948 Nakba&lt;/a&gt; – during which about 70% of the Palestinian population &lt;a href="https://imeu.org/article/quick-facts-the-palestinian-nakba#:~:text=Between%20750%2C000%20and%20one%20million,approximately%2075%25%20of%20all%20Palestinians."&gt;was forcibly displaced&lt;/a&gt; and more than 500 communities &lt;a href="https://www.972mag.com/photos-nakba-depopulated-villages/"&gt;were wiped out&lt;/a&gt; completely. Indeed, for nearly four weeks the Israeli regime has cut off power and limited access to the internet, reducing contact with the outside and meaning the full scale of its assault has been hidden from the world. Some Palestinians in Gaza are still managing to maintain some communication by charging phones in cars and using power from what solar panels are left. Among them are Palestinian journalists – at least 32 media workers &lt;a href="https://cpj.org/2023/11/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/#:~:text=As%20of%20November%203%2C%20CPJ's,and%201%2C400%20deaths%20in%20Israel."&gt;have been killed&lt;/a&gt; since Hamas’s offensive on 7 October – who are risking their lives to show us the devastation that is being wrought upon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yara Hawari is a senior policy fellow at Al Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy Network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <title>Ofcom hits Royal Mail with a regulatory twig | Nils Pratley</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/nov/13/ofcom-royal-mail-fine-universal-service-obligation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regulator’s paltry £5.6m fine suggests it is waiting for the company’s universal service obligation to be reformed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/royal-mail-fined-56m-by-uk-regulator-for-missing-delivery-targets"&gt;Royal Mail fined £5.6m by UK regulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Mail’s bosses always sounded embarrassed about missing targets for delivering regulated letters and parcels on time. But they never appeared fearful of what Ofcom’s investigation would bring. Now one can see why. It turns out that the fine for falling short of required service standards – and falling short by a country mile, note – &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/royal-mail-fined-56m-by-uk-regulator-for-missing-delivery-targets"&gt;is a paltry £5.6m&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put the sum in context, Royal Mail’s &lt;a href="https://www.internationaldistributionsservices.com/media/12036/ids-plc-fy-2022-23-results-rns-18-5-23.pdf"&gt;revenues last year were £7.4bn&lt;/a&gt; and the company put the effect of strikes at £200m, a figure that carries a proper thump. Nor is this a case of a strike-related add-on from Ofcom. The regulator adjusted for industrial action, plus other special factors, and still reckoned Royal Mail fell below standards by “a significant and unexplained margin”. You bet: the adjusted figure for on-time delivery of first-class mail was 82% compared with a target of 93%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/nov/13/ofcom-royal-mail-fine-universal-service-obligation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Suella Braverman has gone, but she proved that hateful xenophobia is never far from the surface in Britain | Nesrine Malik</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-islamophobia-britain-muslim-home-secretary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought that anti-Muslim feeling was on the wane, but it took just a few words from the former home secretary to reignite it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suella Braverman &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-rishi-sunak-cabinet-reshuffle-conservatives-uk-politics-latest"&gt;is gone&lt;/a&gt;, but her message was heard loud and clear. “Hate marchers” who are not interested in Gaza, but in asserting “the primacy by certain groups – particularly Islamists”. This is how Suella Braverman described pro-Palestine protesters &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pro-palestine-protest-london-met-police-cbqnxbtv3"&gt;in a piece for the Times&lt;/a&gt; last week. Far-right protesters, including Tommy Robinson, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/11/suella-braverman-accused-of-fuelling-far-right-violence-near-cenotaph"&gt;turned up in London&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, the day of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/11/hundreds-of-thousands-rally-for-gaza-in-london-as-police-arrest-far-right-protesters"&gt;pro-Palestine march&lt;/a&gt;, to assert their own primacy, and clashed with police. This was not inevitable, but always highly possible. A swirl of Islamophobia and anti-immigration rhetoric have been part of our politics for so long that all it took was one motivated actor to convert them into something explosive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her departure won’t change that. I thought Islamophobia, though durable in both mainstream politics and the press, seemed a bit of a retro thing, peaking some time in the early 2010s, then replaced by a more generic, Brexit-triggered hysteria about “sovereignty”. It seemed that the time had come, in our carousel of public enemies, for another to replace Muslims. Brexit obliged, giving us civil servants, judges, lawyers, and treacherous remainers. But it appears that all it takes is one event and one high-profile politician to summon what is now clear has always been lurking. An episode in which Muslims – spoken of often as “immigrant” outsiders, whether British or not – can be cast as the mischievous protagonists, their motivations suspect, their organisation sinister.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-islamophobia-britain-muslim-home-secretary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

He was visiting Gaza with his son, Yasser, when Israel started&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; bombarding the strip in response to Hamas’s 7 October &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;attacks on Israel. He has been keeping a diary, which he has been sending via WhatsApp to his publisher, Comma Press, in Britain.

      <title>The Guardian view on public sector work: the nursery shortage points to a deeper crisis | Editorial</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From childcare to prisons, acute staffing problems across public services call for bold solutions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember Thursday nights, and the applause for key workers on doorsteps? During the pandemic, people working in demanding, public-facing jobs were rightly and warmly acclaimed. That was then. These days, staff shortages are causing problems across public services, above all in careers demanding high levels of personal interaction, including teaching, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/16/staff-shortages-prison-deaths-coroners-inquests-suicide" title=""&gt;prisons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/23/probation-officers-fear-repeat-of-failings-in-case-as-pressures-mount" title=""&gt;probation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early years is the latest sector to declare that a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/06/staff-exodus-could-hinder-expansion-of-free-childcare-in-england-providers-say" title=""&gt;lack of staff&lt;/a&gt; threatens its capacity to meet families’ needs. According to research by the Early Education and Childcare Coalition, just 17% of nursery managers believe they will be able to offer the “free hours” promised by ministers from next year. About 10,000 people in England have left jobs in nurseries or as childminders since 2019, representing a 3% fall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-public-sector-work-the-nursery-shortage-points-to-a-deeper-crisis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guardian view on farming’s green transition: the politics aren’t looking good | Editorial</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-farmings-green-transition-the-politics-arent-looking-good</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month’s Cop28 climate summit will focus on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Governments need to take note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of our era’s great and inconvenient truths is that global food production and the climate emergency are intimately linked. Drought, flood and other extreme weather events &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/21/rampant-heatwaves-threaten-food-security-of-entire-planet-scientists-warn" title=""&gt;threaten&lt;/a&gt; farming ecosystems across the world. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture play a major role in global heating. We know that the default western diet, with its heavy emphasis on meat and dairy, is harming the planet. Eating habits in wealthy countries will have to change, and livestock numbers be reduced, if climate targets are to be met and vulnerable food systems saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the month, this &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/impact-farming-climate-crisis-key-cop-topic-finally" title=""&gt;message &lt;/a&gt;will be heard front and centre in the next round of the UN climate negotiations. At Cop28 in Dubai, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization will foreground the need to transform patterns of consumption and production if the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is to be met. The emphasis on the impact of food systems is welcome and overdue. For various reasons it has been badly neglected at previous summits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-farmings-green-transition-the-politics-arent-looking-good"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Choosing childlessness for the sake of the planet | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/12/choosing-childlessness-for-the-sake-of-the-planet</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public policies shouldn’t be shaped around boosting birth rates, says &lt;strong&gt;Madeleine Hewitt&lt;/strong&gt;. Plus a letter from &lt;strong&gt;Val Harding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s a tragedy that so many are afraid to have children due to climate breakdown, that doesn’t have to be a decision drawn from fear, but a positive, proactive choice to help solve the climate crisis (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/09/more-people-not-having-children-due-to-climate-breakdown-fears-finds-research" title=""&gt;More people not having children due to climate breakdown fears, finds research, 9 November&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our growing numbers place increasing strain on the environment, with the IPCC having just last year cited population growth as one of the two strongest drivers (alongside per capita GDP) of carbon emissions. A greater public understanding of how the climate crisis will impact future generations is a good thing, motivating and equipping us all to take the actions and demand the changes that are so vitally needed. In light of this, public policies should be shaped to strengthen environmental protections and adapt to managing an ageing population, rather than boost birth rates. A universal human pursuit is to want to improve things for the next generation, even if in this case it means having a smaller one.&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madeleine Hewitt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Campaigns and media officer,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Population Matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/12/choosing-childlessness-for-the-sake-of-the-planet"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>News coverage of war affects us all, but is switching off the right response? | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/news-coverage-of-war-affects-us-all-but-is-switching-off-the-right-response</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Readers respond to an article by Simon Jenkins on the impact of the atrocities constantly being portrayed in the media &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Simon Jenkins for his article about a conundrum I struggle with constantly: how to stay aware of what’s happening in the world without turning my back on it to preserve my own sanity (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/07/we-cannot-turn-away-from-suffering-but-i-can-no-longer-watch-the-news-coverage-from-israel-and-gaza" title=""&gt;We cannot turn away from suffering, but I can no longer watch the news coverage from Israel and Gaza, 7 November&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of a constant bombardment, not of real bombs but of images of suffering people and blasted homes, desensitises us, damaging our mental health and discouraging us from doing those small things we can do – all to no end. As he comments, there is blame without understanding, heat without light.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/news-coverage-of-war-affects-us-all-but-is-switching-off-the-right-response"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Chaotic, occasionally brilliant Chelsea show where Man City are vulnerable | Jonathan Wilson</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/chelsea-man-city-pep-guardiola-control</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not time for Pep Guardiola to panic, but Chelsea’s unpredictable style removed what the manager covets most: control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/20/sign-up-for-soccer-with-jonathan-wilson-his-free-weekly-newsletter-on-european-soccer"&gt;Sign up to Jonathan’s weekly newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what was most striking in Chelsea’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/12/chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report" title=""&gt;4-4 draw&lt;/a&gt; with Manchester City on Sunday was how one team played entirely to type, and one team didn’t. That’s a situation that should give hope not only to Chelsea but to the rest of the league: perhaps this iteration of City is not quite so relentless and remorseless as had been thought. They go into the international break only a point clear of Arsenal and Liverpool, whom they face in the first game back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chelsea are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/nov/12/pochettino-raises-the-pulse-as-chelsea-are-unleashed-as-an-attacking-force" title=""&gt;unpredictable, occasionally brilliant, skittish and chaotic&lt;/a&gt;, and have in Cole Palmer a player who seems as yet not to have been ground down by the game, who regards structures and expectations and pressure with an anarchic insolence. A vital injury‑time penalty against the club he left in August for a player who says he doesn’t really practise penalties? No problem, the ball dispatched calmly into the top corner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/chelsea-man-city-pep-guardiola-control"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Carlos Alcaraz beaten by Alexander Zverev at ATP Finals – as it happened</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Carlos Alcaraz was beaten in three sets by Alexander Zvevev on his ATP Finals debut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here we go!&lt;/strong&gt; Zverev comes out first, aiming to begin his campaign to win a third ATP Finals title and he’s followed by debutant Alcaraz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staging in Turin is incredibly dramatic, which I personally love. The DJ has gone all out as well. Let’s hope the actual tennis matches this pre-match show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You have] to be at your best. The times that I have beaten him, I was playing my absolute best tennis. If you are not quite there, if you are a little slow-ish, if you are not hitting the ball as well as you can, you don’t have any chance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/nov/13/carlos-alcaraz-v-alexander-zverev-atp-finals-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Alexander-Arnold embraces freedom of his emerging midfielder status</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/alexander-arnold-embraces-his-emerging-midfielder-status</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liverpool’s world-class right-back is happy to play a more advanced role in England’s upcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trent Alexander-Arnold being listed as a midfielder in the England squad still looks odd no matter how often he features in the category or dictates play in the hybrid role for Liverpool. Taking it further, it could be interpreted as evidence of England’s confusion over how best to utilise the rare gifts of a very modern full-back. But not by Alexander-Arnold himself. As on the field of play, he finds clarity where others see complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gareth Southgate is likely to need Alexander-Arnold’s creativity in midfield again for the final Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia, especially with James Maddison out of the squad and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/11/he-cant-play-with-england-ancelotti-says-bellingham-out-of-euro-qualifiers"&gt;Jude Bellingham expected to follow suit&lt;/a&gt;. Amid continued debate over his place in the England team, and after the debate over why he did not have a place at all, the 25-year-old will welcome the chance to confirm his listing as an international midfielder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/alexander-arnold-embraces-his-emerging-midfielder-status"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sources say it is to avoid players seeking political asylum abroad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No official explanation as to why federation cancelled games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eritrea’s football federation withdrew its men’s team from 2026 World Cup qualifying owing to fears that players would attempt to seek political asylum during trips abroad, according to sources close to the squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint statement from Fifa and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on Friday said that “all of Eritrea’s matches have been cancelled”, a few days before they had been due to travel to face Morocco in their first fixture, but provided no explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/eritrea-withdrew-from-2026-world-cup-qualifying-over-fears-players-will-flee"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grand National winner’s injuries and Luca Morgan’s shock retirement show the urgent need for jockeys’ voices to be heard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the risks and hardships that jockeys face on a daily basis to ensure that we all have a sport to follow and enjoy have been brought into sharp relief by events over the weekend, as racing hopes for some positive news on Graham Lee after his fall as the stalls opened for a race at Newcastle on Friday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Injured Jockeys Fund said in a statement on Sunday that Lee, a Grand National-winning rider over jumps before a successful switch to ride on the Flat, had “suffered an unstable cervical fracture causing damage to the spinal cord, as well as damage to blood vessels in the mid-cervical region.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/nov/13/talking-horses-graham-lee-fall-dangers-uk-riders-racing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Women’s Super League: talking points from the weekend’s action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manchester City’s title challenge takes a hit, Arsenal find their shooting boots, and Marc Skinner laments complacency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been plenty of commentary around Arsenal’s lack of clinical finishing. Despite finding wins, they have looked unconvincing at times and before Sunday’s game, they had a shot to goal conversion rate of just 14%. In the second half against Leicester, however, they finally put those conversations to bed with a display of ruthless attacking football. Four goals in 12 minutes saw them turn around a two-goal deficit as they sliced through the defence with precision. Stina Blackstenius and Lina Hurtig netted two more to add to the Foxes’ woes. In an extra confidence boost, they had six different scorers, spreading the goals throughout the team. “When you see the players coming on and how involved they are in creating goalscoring opportunities, I really think that’s something that we can use during the season,” the Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, said. “We have both starters and finishers in our forward setup, because we want to have a lot of energy when we’re playing and sometimes that needs fresh legs.” &lt;strong&gt;SD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Brawn and Button’s unlikely F1 fairytale retold in new series</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/13/brawn-button-f1-fairytale-new-disney-series</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Documentary charts how the struggling team bought for £1 went on to win the 2009 championship against the odds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As underdog stories go, the Brawn F1 team’s unlikely triumph in 2009 has it all. From down and out, the team bought for £1 became title favourites overnight, were hunted by their rivals but held out for a last-gasp dip over the finishing line. They were an anomaly and their feat, one surely all but unrepeatable, is captured in an aptly titled new four-part Disney series – Brawn: The Impossible F1 Story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formula One is enjoying a boom thanks in part to the popular Netflix series Drive to Survive but at the same time undergoing a period of domination by Red Bull and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/max-verstappen" title=""&gt;Max Verstappen&lt;/a&gt;. It follows from a similar spell of authority by Mercedes, the team that bought out Brawn at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/13/brawn-button-f1-fairytale-new-disney-series"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A college football coach gets $77m not to work as US education suffers</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/13/a-college-football-coach-gets-77m-not-to-work-as-us-education-suffers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every Texas A&amp;amp;M donor helping to fund Jimbo Fisher’s buyout could have put that check toward tablets or school lunches in a poor district&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University fired football coach Jimbo Fisher on Sunday, amid his latest disappointing season. The axing is richly deserved. The money Fisher will get &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to work is not. In late 2017, A&amp;amp;M poached Fisher – who had won a national championship at Florida State in 2013 – from FSU with a 10-year, $75m, fully guaranteed contract that broke the collegiate record with its total value. The school extended that deal and tacked on dollars in 2021, but Fisher’s performance never got close to matching his paycheck, and the “fully guaranteed” part of the contract would come back to haunt the Aggies. He lost at least four games every year but 2020, when pandemic interruptions created a zany season whose chaos included a 9-1 record and No 4 finish in the rankings for A&amp;amp;M. But even that team fell short of loftier goals like a Southeastern Conference title or College Football Playoff berth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The on-field failures belied not just his deal, but his advantages in the job. A&amp;amp;M signed some of the best recruiting classes in college football, including a 2022 class that scouting agencies considered one of the best ever. In assembling those classes, Fisher had the help of a rich and enthusiastic booster corps, buttressed by oil money who craved success. Nobody was better positioned to take advantage of a recent liberalization of limits on athlete compensation by third parties than A&amp;amp;M. In discussing the firing on Sunday, AD Ross Bjork decried a lack of “consistency, positivity, and confidence” in Fisher’s program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/13/a-college-football-coach-gets-77m-not-to-work-as-us-education-suffers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Let forests grow old to store huge volume of carbon – study</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/13/conserving-restoring-forests-sequester-carbon-study-trees</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Report says cutting emissions should still be key priority as it cautions against mass monoculture tree-planting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest conservation and restoration could make a major contribution to tackling the climate crisis as long as greenhouse gas emissions are slashed, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By allowing existing trees to grow old in healthy ecosystems and restoring degraded areas, scientists say 226 gigatonnes of carbon could be sequestered, equivalent to nearly 50 years of US emissions for 2022. But they caution that mass monoculture tree-planting and offsetting will not help forests realise their potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction"&gt;age of extinction coverage here&lt;/a&gt;, and follow biodiversity reporters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en"&gt;Phoebe Weston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en"&gt;Patrick Greenfield&lt;/a&gt; on X, formerly known as Twitter, for all the latest news and features&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/13/conserving-restoring-forests-sequester-carbon-study-trees"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Floating factories of artificial leaves could make green fuel for jets and ships</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/12/floating-factories-artificial-leaves-green-fuel-jets-ships-carbon-dioxide</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cambridge University scientists develop a device to ‘defossilise’ the economy using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated floating factories that manufacture green versions of petrol or diesel could soon be in operation thanks to pioneering work at the University of Cambridge. The revolutionary system would produce a net-zero fuel that would burn without creating fossil-derived emissions of carbon dioxide, say researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cambridge project is based on a floating artificial leaf which has been developed at the university and which can turn sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into synthetic fuel. The group believe these thin, flexible devices could one day be exploited on a industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/12/floating-factories-artificial-leaves-green-fuel-jets-ships-carbon-dioxide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The French president has called for action at a climate summit in Paris attended by heads of state and scientists before Cop28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France will spend €1bn (£880m) on polar research between now and 2030, amid rapidly rising scientific concern over the world’s melting ice caps and glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new polar science vessel will spearhead the effort, and France is calling for a moratorium on the exploitation of the seabed in polar regions, to which the UK, Canada, Brazil and 19 other countries have so far signed up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/12/emmanuel-macron-pledges-1bn-to-fund-research-into-melting-ice-caps"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Give police more powers amid 10-fold rise in antisemitic attacks, says UK adviser</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;John Woodcock claims largely peaceful Palestinian marches ‘clearly a factor’ in intimidation of Jewish communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government’s adviser on political violence and disruption has said he will recommend giving police stronger powers to prevent demonstrations that intimidate the Jewish community after weeks of successive, largely peaceful pro-Palestinian marches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the independent peer and former Labour MP John Woodcock said: “The problem you have seen over recent weeks is the police grappling with the public order regulations and deciding in this last week, for example, that they didn’t think there was sufficient probability of serious public disorder to be able to ban the march.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/nov/13/give-police-more-powers-amid-10-fold-rise-in-antisemitic-attacks-says-uk-adviser"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scheme would involve abstracting water from the River Thames at Teddington and replacing it with treated sewage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thames Water is facing a public backlash over a multimillion-pound water “recycling” scheme promoted as a solution to tackling climate crisis-induced droughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology involves using effluent from sewage treatment works, putting it through a further layer of treatment and releasing the treated water into a river, in order to replace the same amount of water that is abstracted off for drinking water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/13/campaigners-warn-against-thames-waters-250m-effluent-recycling-scheme"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exclusive: Yvette Greenway-Mansfield given compensation after Coventry’s University Hospital was found to be medically negligent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who suffered traumatic complications from a vaginal mesh implant has been awarded a record settlement of at least £1m from the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yvette Greenway-Mansfield, 59, was given a mesh implant at Coventry’s University Hospital in 2009 and went on to suffer serious complications. Her medical negligence claim against the hospital trust found that the surgery was carried out prematurely and unnecessarily and that her consent form had been doctored to include additional risks after Greenway-Mansfield had signed it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/13/woman-suffered-complications-vaginal-mesh-implant-awarded-1m"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>English charities ‘near insolvency’ after subsidising public sector contracts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exclusive:  Voluntary organisations struggling as grants for local government and NHS contracts fail to cover costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charities in England are on the brink of insolvency after subsidising heavily underfunded local authority and NHS contracts to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds donated to them by the public, voluntary sector leaders have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donations, will legacies and charity shop profits are being used to prop up thousands of state-funded services in danger of closure, including care homes, homeless shelters, addiction projects and physical rehabilitation support schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority were subsidising the cost of providing public services. Nearly half had not received an uplift in the value of the contract in the past two years, despite increasing demand and rising wage and energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contracts were often only viable by freezing or cutting staff pay and conditions. One charity made a senior member of staff redundant, then took them back on as a volunteer to do their old job to keep vital services afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A social care charity started a public fundraising campaign, and sold a building it owned, to raise the cash to maintain a service the council would only part fund. “[We are] not sure we can carry on unless something changes,” it said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/13/charities-near-insolvency-after-subsidising-public-sector-contracts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>UK plans U-turn on powers to halt company takeovers on national security grounds</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/uk-plans-u-turn-on-powers-to-halt-company-takeovers-on-national-security-grounds</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Change of tack has government treading fine line between being ‘more business friendly’ and defending national interest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government is looking to roll back powers to intervene in company takeovers less than two years after they were introduced, in an attempt to be “more business friendly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said the government would review measures “narrowing and refining” the National Security and Investment Act, which only &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/uk-government-extends-powers-to-intervene-in-foreign-takeovers"&gt;entered into force in January 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and allowed much greater scrutiny of foreign investments in British companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/uk-plans-u-turn-on-powers-to-halt-company-takeovers-on-national-security-grounds"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/co-op-boss-criminal-gangs-operating-exempt-from-consequences</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Supermarket group calls for action after police fail to attend nearly 80% of the time to deal with serious offenders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boss of Co-op is calling on the government to take more action to tackle retail crime amid a warning it has reached record levels as criminal gangs are operating “exempt from consequences”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-op said its latest data showed that of the nearly 3,000 occasions this year where security teams detained serious offenders in its stores, the police failed to show up almost four-fifths of the time, leading to a “dangerous pressure cooker” environment that puts store workers and communities at risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/co-op-boss-criminal-gangs-operating-exempt-from-consequences"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whistleblower claims hospital director colluded with ‘online intermediaries’ to sell birth certificates for about £10,750&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six people have been arrested in central China’s Hubei province over alleged involvement in a baby-trafficking ring linked to a hospital in one of the province’s biggest cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations about Xiangyang Jianqiao hospital first came to light on 6 November via a Weibo user by the name of Shangguan Zhengyi, who describes himself as an “anti-trafficking volunteer”. Shangguan posted a series of claims about the hospital’s director, Ye Youzhi, whom he accused of colluding “with online intermediaries” to sell birth certificates for 96,000 yuan (£10,750).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/six-people-arrested-in-hubei-province-china-baby-trafficking-ring"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Campaigners say ‘sovereignty’ law is further step by Viktor Orbán to silence critics and solidify control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungarian rights advocates have raised fears over new legislation that they say could put more pressure on independent media and civil society groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft bill, which Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party is expected to submit on Tuesday, is set to propose creating a new office tasked with investigating activities that threaten Hungary’s “sovereignty”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/hungary-plan-target-foreign-influence-ngo-media-fears-sovereignty"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese and US presidents meeting amid a deteriorating geopolitical climate, with the countries on opposing sides of two major conflicts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year after their last in-person talks, Xi Jinping and Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/10/joe-biden-xi-jinping-meeting-apec-summit"&gt;will come face to face once again&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday in San Francisco, in an encounter that will dominate events at the Apec summit as the Chinese and US presidents seek to stabilise relations in an increasingly fraught geopolitical climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting, which could last several hours, is the culmination of months of lower level dialogues which took place over the summer, with Washington sending more delegates to China than Beijing did to the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/xi-biden-meeting-overshadowed-by-conflicts-in-ukraine-and-israel-and-us-stance-on-taiwan"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nikki Haley to launch $10m ad campaign in bid to overtake Ron DeSantis in GOP fight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Former UN ambassador’s planned investment comes as she battles to emerge as the clear alternative to Donald Trump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikki Haley’s presidential campaign will reserve $10m in television, radio and digital advertising across Iowa and New Hampshire beginning in the first week of December, a massive investment designed to give the former UN ambassador an advantage over the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, at a critical moment in the GOP nomination fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the advertising plans, which represent the Haley campaign’s first official advertising reservation, were obtained by The Associated Press ahead of a public announcement expected on Monday. Haley’s planned investment, as of now, is more than five times larger than DeSantis’s current advertising reserves for the same time period, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/13/nikki-haley-to-launch-10m-ad-campaign-in-bid-to-overtake-ron-desantis-in-gop-fight"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New portrait prize sponsor, the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, has represented the oil company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate campaigners have accused the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/national-portrait-gallery"&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/a&gt; of “jumping out of the reputational frying pan straight into the reputational fire” after it announced its replacement sponsor for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; is a law firm that has represented the fossil fuel company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gallery said last year it was ending its &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/22/national-portrait-gallery-and-bp-to-cut-ties-after-30-years"&gt;30-year partnership with BP&lt;/a&gt; after a lengthy campaign against its relationship with the oil and gas company. On Monday, it announced that the new sponsor for its portrait prize, one of the UK’s most prestigious art prizes, formerly known as the BP portrait award, would be Herbert Smith Freehills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/13/national-portrait-gallery-criticised-over-choice-of-sponsor-to-replace-bp"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Miguel Atwood-Ferguson on his giant 50-song album: ‘I wanted to approach it like an experiment’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/13/miguel-atwood-ferguson-superstar-arranger-interview</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The composer and arranger has worked with everyone from Ray Charles to Rihanna. Now he’s stepping into the spotlight with a mammoth three and a half hour debut LP … and that’s just volume one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are you have already heard Miguel Atwood-Ferguson’s work. You may not know who the LA-based composer and strings player is, but if you’ve listened to contemporary American music or watched recent TV and film from the US, you will have likely heard the sound of his bow sweeping across orchestral strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Softly spoken and typically dressed down in a washed-out T-shirt and sweatpants, Atwood-Ferguson is the unassuming presence behind orchestrations and performances for everyone from Ray Charles to Stevie Wonder, via Quincy Jones, Rihanna, Dr Dre and the Roots. In the past decade, he has become a key part of the west coast beats and jazz scene that coalesced around artists such as the producer Flying Lotus, saxophonist Kamasi Washington and bassist Thundercat, all releasing on Flying Lotus’s label Brainfeeder. Bridging the worlds of classical, jazz, hip-hop and pop, Atwood-Ferguson – who has more than 600 recordings to his name and in excess of 2,500 live shows played in the past two decades – is the go-to guy to provide spaces of instrumental beauty in busy sound worlds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/13/miguel-atwood-ferguson-superstar-arranger-interview"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Marvels records worst ever North American opening weekend box office for MCU</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/13/the-marvels-records-worst-ever-north-american-opening-weekend-performance-for-mcu-marvel-cinematic-universe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marvel Cinematic Universe’s latest superhero movie took $47m over its first three days in US and Canadian cinemas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New superhero movie The Marvels has recorded the lowest ever north American opening weekend box office for any Marvel Cinematic Universe film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Marvel-Cinematic-Universe#tab=summary&amp;amp;franchise_movies_overview=oa3"&gt;Data site the Numbers reports&lt;/a&gt; that The Marvels, which stars Brie Larson as Captain Marvel alongside Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau and Iman Vellani as Ms Marvel, took an estimated $47m (£38.4m) over its first three days in US and Canadian cinemas, meaning that it has displaced The Incredible Hulk as the MCU’s worst recorded opening; the latter managed $55.4m on its release in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/13/the-marvels-records-worst-ever-north-american-opening-weekend-performance-for-mcu-marvel-cinematic-universe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Driving Madeleine review – hankies at the ready as a life is told in flashback</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/13/driving-madeleine-review-hankies-at-the-ready-as-a-life-is-told-in-flashback</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Line Renaud and Dany Boon give low-key, sincere performances as they reunite for an eventful cab ride through Paris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fourth collaboration between French funnyman Dany Boon and one-time music-hall sensation Line Renaud (who played his mother in 2008 Euro-hit &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/04/news.france"&gt;Bienvenue Chez Les Ch’tis&lt;/a&gt;), this two-hander has a strong conceit: Madeleine (Renaud) relives her life in the backseat of the cab driving her through Paris to a nursing home, with troubled chauffeur Charles (Boon) as her confessor. The film’s gaze is fixed in the rear-view mirror far more than the Before Sunset-style dalliance it occasionally resembles, but it’s not straightforwardly nostalgic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madeleine’s tale starts off rose-tinted: played in flashback by Alice Isaaz, she has a wartime romance with an American soldier, which produces a son. But after her Yank beau heads back over the Atlantic, she takes up with wrong ’un Ray (Jérémie Laheurte), who resents the kid and wants her for himself. To Charles’s incredulity, she stomachs the beatings he hands out, until one day Ray backhands her child. Which is when this demure theatre-dresser goes unexpectedly medieval on his ass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/13/driving-madeleine-review-hankies-at-the-ready-as-a-life-is-told-in-flashback"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I felt shame about my labia’: High Steaks, the hit show barbecuing body image</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/13/performance-artist-eloina-high-steaks-labia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Performing naked except for a well-positioned accordion, sprig of parsley or mirror, Eloina Haines tackles labia-shaming by chopping up slices of beef and grilling them. She explains all to our writer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eloina Haines always knew she wanted to be on stage as herself, rather than perform in a play that “some old white dude wrote a million years ago”. A queer performance artist known solely by her first name, Eloina has made shows about menstruation, body hair and female ejaculation since graduating in 2018 and is quite often undressed on stage. The nakedness is always for a reason, she stresses. “It is about decensoring the body for myself,” she says. “At the same time, it’s to liberate others in their own bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began by performing in underground spaces – the kind of weird and wonderful cabaret nights that switch from burlesque to drag “to a video piece about birthing – and then someone emerges wearing a pig’s head,” she says playfully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/13/performance-artist-eloina-high-steaks-labia"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The mystery of the garden of memories at the Angel of the North</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/13/angel-of-the-north-garden-of-memories</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Folded and unfolded notes, straggles of ribbon, artificial flowers – a professor is searching for the roots of the phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a scrubby copse of alder trees near one of north-east England’s busiest roads and in the shadow of one its most famous landmarks, the Angel of the North, is a spontaneous, secret garden of memories. An academic is on a mission to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m interested in how objects and places help people, in terms of grief,” says Prof Anne Whitehead. “What significance do the objects here have? What is it about this site that has drawn them to leave things here? Did they come here with the person they are remembering? Is it because of the Angel? Is it because they feel the Angel represents the region?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/13/angel-of-the-north-garden-of-memories"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Many people still need support’: how a Ukrainian refugee helps others fleeing the conflict</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/oct/09/many-people-still-need-support-how-a-ukrainian-refugee-helps-others-fleeing-the-conflict</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like millions of other Ukrainians, Veronika Riepina had to leave her country behind. Now, having found refuge in the UK, she is working with the British Red Cross to assist new arrivals – and looking forward to the day she can return home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Veronika Riepina was a typical 23-year-old. She was renting an apartment in Kyiv, working hard to make her way in the film industry, and making plans to apply for funding to shoot her own documentary project. She was thrilled to work on Do You Love Me?, a coming-of-age film directed by Tonia Noyabrova. She couldn’t have imagined they would wrap up just days before the conflict escalated, nor that she’d be living in the UK when the film debuted at the Berlin film festival. “I feel a sense of joy that we managed to finish shooting and that despite all of the difficulties with post-production, the film still came out,” says Riepina. “It seems like a lifetime ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to leave Ukraine wasn’t an easy one. She had been visiting her parents in Zaporizhzhia in the south-east of the country for a short holiday. “I was only planning to stay for a couple of days. I had a small backpack, my laptop and two T-shirts with me,” she says. But after five days of explosions, her father decided she and her mother had to leave. They drove for a week to get to the border with Poland. From there, Riepina and her mother took the train to Berlin where they applied at the UK visa office to stay with a relative who lived in Blackpool. They arrived in the UK in March 2022. “I know from speaking to people who came after us, that we were relatively lucky,” says Riepina. “Although it was dangerous leaving Ukraine, we didn’t have to stay in any refugee camps and we managed to get here relatively cheaply and quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the ground in Ukraine, teams from the Hungarian and Polish Red Cross provide emergency assistance to civilians in the conflict zone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/oct/09/many-people-still-need-support-how-a-ukrainian-refugee-helps-others-fleeing-the-conflict"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Our work is changing all the time’: why no two days are the same for an emergency responder</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/sep/28/our-work-is-changing-all-the-time-why-no-two-days-are-the-same-for-an-emergency-responder</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From assisting people fleeing the conflict in Sudan to supporting those affected by fires or floods, the British Red Cross is always ready to respond during a crisis. Here, two volunteers share the experiences that have shaped them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed Abdulkarim remembers clearly the first time he was called out as a British Red Cross emergency response volunteer four years ago. A fire, thought to have been started by a discarded cigarette, ripped through a seven-storey student accommodation block in Bolton within minutes. All 217 students were safely rescued from the blaze thanks to 200 firefighters and fire engines from across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was up to Abdulkarim and his trained British Red Cross team to run the emergency centre set up in the borough, which is part of Greater Manchester, to support students made homeless by the fire. “The entire building had burnt down and the whole of the area had to be evacuated,” he says. “I was based in the rest centre where a flow of people were coming in and dropping off clothes and hygiene packs as well as making donations.” He gave whatever help was needed. “Sometimes that meant just sitting down and listening to somebody who needed to talk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an emergency responder, Mohammed Abdulkarim has provided support to people made homeless by fire, distributed food parcels during the pandemic and welcomed refugees from Ukraine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/sep/28/our-work-is-changing-all-the-time-why-no-two-days-are-the-same-for-an-emergency-responder"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We gave all the support we could’: how the Red Cross responded to the Turkey-Syria earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/oct/13/we-gave-all-the-support-we-could-how-the-red-cross-responded-to-the-turkey-syria-earthquakes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, volunteers such as Meltem Elmaci and specialist responders like Julia Brothwell were on the ground giving vital assistance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Meltem Elmaci thinks back to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-syria-earthquake-2023"&gt;earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria&lt;/a&gt; in February this year, one memory stands out. As she and her fellow Turkish Red Crescent volunteers handed out donated gift boxes to child survivors, they asked each child to describe their dream toy. One little girl, Ayşe, described the doll she wanted, using a stick to draw a picture of it on the ground. Opening the gift box, she saw a doll exactly as she’d imagined it – “from the colour of the skirt to the jewellery on her arm”, says Elmaci. No one could explain it, but the incident affected them deeply. “It made us all very happy to realise the dream of a child,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moments such as these are cherished by volunteers when they find themselves surrounded by the destruction and misery caused by an earthquake. Now head of the Ankara branch, a voluntary role she carries out in addition to her job as a teacher, Elmaci has been involved with the Turkish Red Crescent almost all her life. As a child, she was a member of her primary school’s branch, collecting books and toys for children who needed them, but it was the sight of the Turkish Red Crescent vests at the 1999 Marmara earthquake that led to her joining as a volunteer. Her role now involves being ready, when disaster hits, to organise a volunteer response, bringing food, water, clothes, bedding, schooling and psychosocial support to those affected. “Wherever there is a need, we are there,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meltem Elmaci provided urgent help, such as delivering essentials to families&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/oct/13/we-gave-all-the-support-we-could-how-the-red-cross-responded-to-the-turkey-syria-earthquakes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>10 things you didn’t know about the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/oct/26/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-red-cross-and-red-crescent-movement</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has been supporting people through conflicts, disasters and emergencies for more than 150 years. Read on to discover 10 inspiring facts about one of the world’s leading humanitarian organisations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement started with the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863, in response to the terrible human toll of the revolutionary conflicts raging in Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Seven years later the British Red Cross was established. Today, the Movement is active in 192 countries and has been a constant and reassuring presence at some of the world’s most harrowing events: from being among the first to provide humanitarian support after the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, to providing vital assistance to those affected by this year’s devastating earthquakes in Morocco, Turkey and Syria. You may know some of these facts, but did you know … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 The Red Cross’s ‘red cross’ is not a logo&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Even though it is one of the most recognisable pieces of graphic design in the world, the red cross &lt;a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redcross.org.uk%2Femblem&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7COliviaJones%40redcross.org.uk%7C6cb09cee4ae84800102908dbd007ee6d%7Cfedc3cbaca5e4388a837b45c7f0d71b7%7C0%7C0%7C638332504716824623%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=F%2BA3VU1CfL0f7XHLjjMi365cpvnxnuOL0J0pLhglFK8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow"&gt;emblem&lt;/a&gt; is not just some clever bit of branding: it is a symbol of protection in armed conflict, the use of which is restricted by international law. The Red Cross’s guiding principles of neutrality and impartiality mean that it does not take sides and is here for anyone and everyone who needs help, regardless of religion, political affiliation or nationality or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 The Red Cross is still tracing people who went missing during the second world war – as well as those caught up in emergencies today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is now almost 80 years since the end of the conflict, but the Red Cross is still helping people trace what happened to their family members who went missing in the course of the second world war or in its aftermath. This remarkable service is emblematic of the wider work the &lt;a href="https://www.redcross.org.uk/get-help/find-missing-family" rel="nofollow"&gt;British Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; and the Red Cross Movement do together around the world to locate people and put them back into contact with their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/british-red-cross-here-for-humanity/2023/oct/26/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-red-cross-and-red-crescent-movement"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rukmini Iyer’s quick and easy recipe for pink potato salad with red cabbage and pomegranate | Quick and easy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/13/quick-easy-recipe-pink-potato-salad-red-cabbage-pomegranate-butter-beans-rukmini-iyer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flavour, texture and colour abound in this healthy addition to your winter table&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook once, eat twice: this is one of my favourite winter potato salads – the red cabbage and pomegranate add flavour, texture and colour, and with butter beans for protein, you’ve got all your food groups covered. It’s perfect for a light dinner with good bread and butter alongside, and any leftovers are excellent in lunchboxes the next day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/13/quick-easy-recipe-pink-potato-salad-red-cabbage-pomegranate-butter-beans-rukmini-iyer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘A delirious deco dream’: former TB sanatorium is now Finland’s most unusual holiday let</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/nov/13/stay-in-art-deco-splendour-former-tb-sanatorium-is-now-finlands-most-unusual-holiday-let</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a limited period, architecture lovers can spend the night in a modernist masterpiece designed by Alvar Aalto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep in a forest two hours’ drive west of Helsinki is the deserted &lt;a href="https://paimiosanatorium.com/"&gt;Paimio&lt;/a&gt; Sanatorium (Paimion Parantola in Finnish). One of the world’s best-preserved buildings from the modernist era, it’s as clean, sleek and mysterious as a medical instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overnight stay in a remote, disused hospital may not sound enticing. But for architecture and design enthusiasts, some opportunities are impossible to resist – and this one is time-limited. At least part of this building is likely to be converted into a hotel and spa in the coming years. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/21/secret-life-architect-alvar-aalto"&gt;Alvar Aalto&lt;/a&gt; Foundation, which preserves the legacy of Finland’s most celebrated architect, took over the site three years ago from state ownership, and is searching for a way to pay for its upkeep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/nov/13/stay-in-art-deco-splendour-former-tb-sanatorium-is-now-finlands-most-unusual-holiday-let"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A new start after 60: I learned to surf – despite the alligators</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/a-new-start-after-60-i-learned-to-surf-despite-the-alligators</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kerrie Houston Reightley has always been athletic, and thought she would be able to pick up surfing. Months of ‘crashing and burning’ ensued, but her competitive nature kept her going&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerrie Houston Reightley has always been sporty. Three&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;years ago, she was on holiday in Maui, Hawaii, with her husband and their son, then 18. “We were walking along the beach. There were all these things you could do – snorkelling, trekking. And I was like: ‘Learn to surf!’ I want to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 64-year-old is a writer and substitute teacher, and clearly believes in research. She went back to the hotel and started watching videos on how to surf. “I was standing on the bed, trying to balance,” she says. But out on the water, it was a different matter. She was out of her depth, in all senses. “I’m athletic. I do spin classes, I cross-train, I row and I play a lot of tennis. I do a lot of things. I thought: I ought to be able to do this.” Photographs show her “crashing and burning”. She never got up on the board – but vowed to go back for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/04/tell-us-has-your-life-taken-a-new-direction-after-the-age-of-65"&gt;Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/a-new-start-after-60-i-learned-to-surf-despite-the-alligators"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Skincare, blow dries and the importance of lunch: party people share their glam routines</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/14/skincare-blow-dries-and-the-importance-of-lunch-party-people-share-their-glam-routines</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four party enthusiasts describe how they get ready for a big night, from being well rested to finding the right outfit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl"&gt;Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year some passages of letters my grandmother sent during the second world war made it into Mike Carlton’s naval history book, The Scrap Iron Flotilla. She was an actor and married to a commander in the navy, my grandfather. By all accounts, she was fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Her doings at balls, parties and suppers were often in the newspapers,” Carlton writes. In one of her letters, she recounts doing the boomps-a-daisy with the HMAS Sydney&lt;em&gt;’s &lt;/em&gt;doctor and a waltz with the captain. “We finished up en masse in the Palais Glide,” she writes. “It was 3am before the party broke up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/14/skincare-blow-dries-and-the-importance-of-lunch-party-people-share-their-glam-routines"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rachel Roddy’s recipe for potato flatbreads with anchovy butter | A kitchen in Rome</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/13/potato-flatbreads-anchovy-butter-recipe-rachel-roddy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the secret to life, the universe and everything – including these irrestible flatbreads – is, in fact, a small potato&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name a dish that isn’t improved, or unaffected, by the addition of a small potato? For this question to make sense, a bit of context would probably be useful. It started years ago, with thick soups and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/05/pasta-potato-soup-minestre-recipe-rachel-roddy"&gt;minestre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which my partner believes should &lt;em&gt;always, always&lt;/em&gt; include a small potato. His reasons are two. Potatoes are wonderful! And they collapse as they cook, adding a starchy softness that thickens the soup Now, I agree with him wholeheartedly. However, I sometimes forget this important addition when making pasta and lentils or chickpea soup, meaning we now have a running (not very funny) joke that, when I do forget, we taste and invariably agree that it would have been better with&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the damned potato&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The damned potato became even more significant when testing recipes for &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/an-a-z-of-pasta-9780241402504"&gt;my pasta book&lt;/a&gt;. There are several recipes – pasta with pesto &lt;em&gt;alla &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;genovese&lt;/em&gt;, pasta with walnut sauce, pasta with mussels (to name just a few) – that call for a potato to be cooked in with the pasta. As in a soup, the potato collapses (a bit or a lot, depending on the variety) and, as a consequence, gives out starch. Now, you’d be correct in thinking that, when it comes to cooking pasta, starch is hardly in short supply; masses of it seeps from the pasta as it cooks, as evidenced by the increasingly cloudywater. But add potato starch to pasta starch, even a small amount, and when you toss the pasta with the sauce and a ladle of the starchy pasta cooking water, things do come together even better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/13/potato-flatbreads-anchovy-butter-recipe-rachel-roddy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rishi Sunak has sacked &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/suella-braverman"&gt;Suella Braverman&lt;/a&gt; as home secretary after she was blamed for inflaming tensions over Armistice Day protests and saying police favoured leftwing protesters.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sound of singing and music drowns out the ambulance sirens in this school for displaced families in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.&amp;nbsp;Thousands of children have lost their homes and had to flee since the Israel-Hamas conflict began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, volunteers like Mohammed Aborjela spend their days going from school to school and offering these children a glimpse back into their childhood with games and fun activities.&amp;nbsp; 'The kids come back really happy, they revive their playful spirit,' said one parent.&amp;nbsp;While it won’t bring back their homes or loved ones, volunteers are hoping that making time for play in a war zone will help these children recover from the trauma of living under siege.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/nov/10/a-safe-space-for-gazas-children-they-still-have-dreams-for-the-future-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'I'm scared to leave my home': West Bank resident on increasing settler violence – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/nov/07/west-bank-resident-on-increasing-settler-violence-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Masafer Yatta, a collection of shepherding hamlets, is in Area C, the sparsely populated 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli control and under threat of annexation. Palestinian water cisterns, solar panels, roads and buildings are frequently demolished on the grounds that they do not have building permits, which are nearly impossible to obtain, while surrounding illegal Israeli settlements flourish. One Palestinian resident, Alaa Hathleen, told the Guardian he and his neighbours were under threat. Over the past three weeks, he says, settlers have burned down homes and attacked Palestinians residing there, as violence from Israeli settlers and IDF forces has intensified in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/west-bank-palestinian-villages-israeli-army-settlers"&gt;‘A new Nakba’: settler violence forces Palestinians out of West Bank villages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/nov/07/west-bank-resident-on-increasing-settler-violence-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite facing multiple criminal charges, Donald Trump remains the frontrunner in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. But in South Carolina, a traditionally conservative southern state, a split is opening up between Trump loyalists and more moderate Republicans who are fearful of what their party has become. The Guardian’s &lt;strong&gt;Oliver Laughland&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tom Silverstone&lt;/strong&gt; investigate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2023/nov/06/why-are-republicans-still-supporting-donald-trump-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2023/nov/02/ilya-the-ai-scientist-shaping-the-world</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever, one of the leading AI scientists behind ChatGPT, reflects on his founding vision and values. In conversations with the film-maker Tonje Hessen Schei as he was developing the chat language model&amp;nbsp;between 2016 and 2019, he describes his personal philosophy and makes startling predictions for a technology already shaping our world.  Reflecting on his ideas today, amid a global debate over safety and regulation,&amp;nbsp;we consider the opportunities as well as the consequences of AI technology. Ilya discusses his&amp;nbsp;ultimate goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI),&amp;nbsp;‘a computer system that can do any job or task that a human does, but better’,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;questions whether the AGI arms race will be good or bad for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These filmed interviews with Ilya Sutskever are part of a feature-length documentary on artificial intelligence, called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001q1zl"&gt;iHuman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2023/nov/02/ilya-the-ai-scientist-shaping-the-world"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is so complicated – video explainer</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/mar/01/why-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict-is-so-complex-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Israel and Palestine jump from crisis to crisis, but a string of deadly attacks over the past few weeks has raised fears the Holy Land is spiralling toward unrelenting bloodshed, with speculation it is on the brink of an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/05/guardian-200-israel-middle-east-ian-black-reporting"&gt;intifada&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a Palestinian uprising or, literally, a 'shaking off' of Israeli control. The first two uprisings failed to end the occupation, with several thousand people killed, mostly Palestinians. Some believe a third intifada has already started.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what makes the decades-old conflict so complex? The Guardian's Jerusalem correspondent, Bethan McKernan, examines the key figures and issues at play – and looks at why experts fear peace is further away than ever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/mar/01/why-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict-is-so-complex-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Into the wild to fight Scotland’s addiction problems – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2023/oct/17/into-the-wild-to-fight-scotlands-addiction-problems-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scotland has some of the highest drug deaths in Europe, a deepening mental health crisis and loses between three and four people a day to suicide. Yet at the same time, services are being stripped back leaving a gap in support that is often filled with volunteers who have a personal experience of addiction. Guardian reporter&lt;strong&gt; Danny Lavelle&lt;/strong&gt;, joined one of those organisations,&lt;a href="https://www.fireandpeace.co.uk/donatef49146f3"&gt; Fire &amp;amp; Peace&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to encourage bonds with nature to help people beat the cycle of addiction, on a trip to the Scottish Highlands. As a natural sceptic of alternative therapies, could he be convinced of the benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2023/oct/17/into-the-wild-to-fight-scotlands-addiction-problems-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

The group was led by Rose and Emma whose message to the young people they helped was to be their best, and never give up. So when they were told they had to leave, there was only one thing to do: occupy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2023/oct/10/occupy-tottenham-a-community-defends-its-home-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How British colonialism increased diabetes in south Asians</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/12/how-british-colonialism-increased-diabetes-in-south-asians</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People of south Asian origin today are between four and six times more likely to get type 2 diabetes than white people. While the role of diet and lifestyle has been explored, it’s only recently that the impact of the disproportionate number of famines under British colonial rule has been uncovered. Neelam Tailor looks into the history of famines during the British Raj and their lasting impact on south Asian genes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/12/how-british-colonialism-increased-diabetes-in-south-asians"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We save 98% of our patients’: inside a frontline Ukrainian field hospital</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/im-focused-on-my-work-inside-a-frontline-ukrainian-field-hospital</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Medics work in makeshift conditions, even while targeted by Russian bombs, to stabilise patients before they can be taken to hospitals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a field hospital on the eastern front all was calm. And then, suddenly, it wasn’t. A casualty arrived. It was a badly wounded Ukrainian soldier. An enemy mortar had landed nearby, leaving him with shrapnel wounds. Within seconds a team of medics got to work. Their operating theatre was in a former apartment, now functioning as a clinic. Children’s drawings with patriotic messages – Glory to Ukraine! – hung on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unconscious patient was transferred onto an operating table. He looked more dead than alive. Doctors gave emergency transfusions of blood and plasma. A paramedic cut away his uniform. Another bandaged his left leg. A third gave him a shot of fentanyl, a powerful painkiller. A heart monitor beeped. Outside were regular whumps from outgoing Ukrainian artillery. The frontline with the Russians was 5km away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/13/im-focused-on-my-work-inside-a-frontline-ukrainian-field-hospital"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I’m more worried today than I was on January 6’: top conservative’s warning to America</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/13/january-6-michael-luttig-trump-warning</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Retired judge Michael Luttig is battling to stop a Trump victory – which he says would be ‘catastrophic for America’s democracy’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Luttig knows the eye of the storm. On the night of 4 January 2021, the retired federal judge advised Mike Pence, the vice-president, against trying to overturn the results of the presidential election. Last year on live television he &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/16/trump-clear-present-danger-to-us-democracy-conservative-judge-warns"&gt;delivered compelling testimony&lt;/a&gt; to the congressional panel investigating the January 6 insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with less than a year until the nation goes back to the polls, Luttig recognises that the battle to save the American republic from the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/05/i-am-your-retribution-trump-rules-supreme-at-cpac-as-he-relaunches-bid-for-white-house"&gt;demagoguery of Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; is far from over – and he is more worried than ever before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/13/january-6-michael-luttig-trump-warning"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Leave the gold in the ground’: Ecuador’s forest guardians mobilise against illegal mining in Amazon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Indigenous A’i Cofán people invoke their ancestors and carry spears but also use drones, GPS mapping and the courts as they fight to protect their land from a rapacious gold rush&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With short amulet-covered spears made of blackened chonta palm, GIS mapping phones, walkie-talkies and wearing black and green uniforms, the A’i Cofán seem to merge into the jungle as they march silently down a path through their land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling themselves the Indigenous guard, the 27-strong group patrols a territory of 243 sq miles (630 sq km), stretching from more than 2,500 metres above sea level in the Andean foothills down into the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/13/illegal-gold-mining-ecuador-amazon-ai-cofan-indigenous-guardians-mobilise"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Catholic dioceses are declaring bankruptcy. Abuse survivors say it’s a ‘way to silence’ them</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The insolvency of California dioceses has caused some cases be put on hold, even as a $175m cathedral has risen over Oakland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Oakland, California, the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Christ the Light is difficult to miss. Towering over Lake Merritt in the heart of the city, its modernist glass dome reflects the East Bay sun in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building, which was completed in 2008 and financed by the Roman Catholic diocese of Oakland, cost $175m. But that price tag confounds Joseph Piscitelli.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/sex-abuse-catholic-church-bankruptcy-oakland-califonia"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We can’t carry on’: the godfather of microplastics on how to stop them</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/13/godfather-microplastics-richard-thompson-how-to-stop-them</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/12/countries-meeting-nairobi-kenya-global-plastic-pollution-treaty"&gt;UN summit in Nairobi debates a treaty on plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Thompson, the biologist who first identified microplastics 30 years ago, explains why ocean cleanups and biodegradables will not solve a global crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1993, during a beach clean on the Isle of Man, Richard Thompson noticed thousands of multicoloured fragments at his feet, looking like sand. While his colleagues filled sacks with crisp packets, fishing rope, plastic bags and bottles, Thompson became transfixed by the particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were so tiny that they did not fit any category in the spreadsheet where volunteers recorded their findings. “Yet it was pretty clear to me that the most abundant item on the beach was the smallest stuff,” Thompson says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/13/godfather-microplastics-richard-thompson-how-to-stop-them"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Scunthorpe faces 2,000 job losses in a move to greener tech, MPs and unions fear for workers and a strategic UK industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Barnes, co-owner of the Lucky Tuppence sweetshop on Scunthorpe’s high street, has experienced the decline of the UK’s steel industry first-hand: he was made redundant in 1981, when Margaret Thatcher’s government cut thousands of jobs. Barnes said the lack of investment in steel in the decades that followed has felt like “a way of punching the north”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between weighing lollipops and chocolate buttons from the array of jars that line his shelves, he is now contemplating the latest blow to the town: British Steel’s plans&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/06/british-steel-scunthorpe-furnaces-jobs" title=""&gt; to axe more than 2,000 jobs in Scunthorpe&lt;/a&gt;, out of a workforce of about 3,800, in a shift to greener technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/12/iron-resolve-steel-town-unites-to-fight-for-its-furnaces"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Is the wealth gap ruining friendships?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/12/is-the-wealth-gap-ruining-friendships</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do your friends earn more than you? Did their parents give them a helping hand? We explore how money can come between friends and family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samira from London doesn’t really speak to her brother any more. “We were best buddies, but I barely see him now,” she says regretfully. There was no big blowout, no obvious turning point. But, rather, Samira and her older brother gradually stopped speaking after he made a fortune from his tech start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As he got richer, it changed our relationship massively.” Samira, 44, who lives in London, asked not to be identified by her real name, as did the other people I interviewed – this is a difficult thing to talk about honestly and, it seems, near impossible to talk about openly. She works in advertising mostly, but also sometimes in bars “when things get really hard”. Her brother, she says, “is basically a millionaire now”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/12/is-the-wealth-gap-ruining-friendships"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We are the resistance’: show of defiance by Hamas as funeral parade follows battle in Jenin</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/resistance-defiancee-hamas-funeral-parade-jenin-israeli-raids-west-bank</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Israeli raids raise tensions in a West Bank paying the human price of war&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/12/israel-hamas-war-live-netanyahu-vows-to-press-on-with-full-force-as-fighting-rages-around-main-gaza-hospital"&gt;Israel-Hamas war: live updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the march through the town centre, the men dispersed: to mosques, to their homes, to the few stands that had opened to sell juice or coffee. Many were armed, cradling their M16 assault rifles and ammunition in their arms. All were young, with close-cropped hair, wearing black T-shirts and baseball caps, trainers or combat boots, and all ready to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before, many had done exactly that. A raid by Israeli forces into Jenin, a town in the far north of the occupied West Bank, had led to a protracted and chaotic battle. When it ended, 14 were dead and many more injured. These included at least two non-combatants: a 31-year-old paramedic badly wounded when she tried to retrieve an injured militant, and a 40-year-old construction worker who was killed. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said they had &lt;a href="https://t.me/s/idfofficial" title=""&gt;detained terrorist leaders,&lt;/a&gt; destroyed terrorist infrastructure and seized a stash of handmade bombs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/12/resistance-defiancee-hamas-funeral-parade-jenin-israeli-raids-west-bank"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How digital twins may enable personalised health treatment</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/12/digital-twin-personalised-medical-treatment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research is growing into computational models that will move medicine beyond what works on the average patient&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine having a digital twin that gets ill, and can be experimented on to identify the best possible treatment, without you having to go near a pill or a surgeon’s knife. Scientists believe that within five to 10 years, “in silico” trials – in which hundreds of virtual organs are used to assess the safety and efficacy of drugs – could become routine, while patient-specific organ models could be used to personalise treatment and avoid medical complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital twins are computational models of physical objects or processes, updated using data from their real-world counterparts. Within medicine, this means combining vast amounts of data about the workings of genes, proteins, cells and whole-body systems with patients’ personal data to create virtual models of their organs – and eventually, potentially their entire body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/12/digital-twin-personalised-medical-treatment"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Brazil to Egypt, Turkey to Hong Kong, the 2010s saw a series of huge public uprisings. Yet many of them led to the opposite of what they asked for.

      <title>Rebuilding Paradise: five years on from California’s deadliest fire</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/nov/13/rebuilding-paradise-five-years-on-from-californias-deadliest-fire</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five years after a wildfire killed 85 people in the Californian town of Paradise, the area has been rebuilt from the ashes. Dani Anguiano and Alastair Gee report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This firestorm just descended upon them,” Guardian US reporter &lt;strong&gt;Dani Anguiano&lt;/strong&gt; tells &lt;strong&gt;Hannah Moore&lt;/strong&gt;. “It was dark, it was smoky, it was incredibly hot, and people there had no warning at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Camp Fire began on an unseasonably warm morning in November 2018. A Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric (PG&amp;amp;E) transmission line off a dirt track called Camp Creek Road sparked the blaze, which quickly spread across the county. At least 85 people were killed and around 90% of the buildings in the town of Paradise were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/nov/13/rebuilding-paradise-five-years-on-from-californias-deadliest-fire"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Elections 2023: Republicans lose big on issue of abortion – podcast</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2023/nov/10/elections-2023-republicans-lose-big-on-issue-of-abortion-podcast</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was a big night for the Democrats, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/08/democrat-biden-poll-election-virginia-kentucky-ohio"&gt;big wins in some unexpected places&lt;/a&gt;: Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky. Abortion rights advocates were celebrating, their hopes lifted ahead of next year’s presidential election, despite some gloomy polls for Joe Biden. Republicans, meanwhile, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/08/key-takeaways-republican-presidential-debate-miami"&gt;presidential candidates&lt;/a&gt; who took to the debate stage on Wednesday, are reeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do the results mean for 2024? Should Republicans rethink their message on abortion? And why is it that despite Donald Trump spending the week in court on trial for fraud, it’s Joe Biden who’s suffering in the polls?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Freedland is joined by Tara Setmayer and Simon Rosenberg to discuss it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archive: CBS News, CNN, NBC News, ABC News, Sky News, MSNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2023/nov/10/elections-2023-republicans-lose-big-on-issue-of-abortion-podcast"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Suella Braverman, the police and the protests – podcast</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/nov/10/suella-braverman-the-police-and-the-protests-podcast</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Senior members of the government have spent the week calling for Saturday’s pro-Palestinian march to be banned but the Metropolitan police have resisted the pressure. Daniel Boffey reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have gathered in central London and other cities around the UK to protest against the Israeli bombing of Gaza – and the UK government’s endorsement of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Guardian’s chief reporter &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Boffey&lt;/strong&gt; tells &lt;strong&gt;Michael Safi, &lt;/strong&gt;these marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful events, although there have been instances of controversial chants and signs and a number of arrests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/nov/10/suella-braverman-the-police-and-the-protests-podcast"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/13/a-year-on-the-river-thames-part-four-in-pictures</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth instalment in a series of photo essays looking at the life on the Thames. From dawn sculls to a duck derby and container barges, Jill Mead, a longtime London resident and urban photographer, shares the stories of the many characters working on and enjoying the river&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thames in a year, who was I kidding? It’s a struggle to believe I meet deadlines on a daily basis. This chapter of my journey includes return trips in better weather, invites too lovely to turn down, unexplored regions … and the odd logistical nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dawn scull on the Thames at Port Meadow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/13/a-year-on-the-river-thames-part-four-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The big picture: campesinos unite in Tina Modotti’s Mexico</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/12/the-big-picture-faceless-campesinos-unite-in-tina-modotti-mexico</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The contemporary of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo uses her art to highlight peasant farmers fighting for agrarian reform in this 1927 picture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Italian-born silent-film star, photographer and model &lt;a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/4039"&gt;Tina Modotti&lt;/a&gt; took this picture in Mexico in 1927. She had moved to live full-time in Mexico City from Los Angeles four years earlier with her lover and fellow photographer &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/aug/18/edward-weston-photography"&gt;Edward Weston&lt;/a&gt; and the pair of them became part of an artistic avant garde that included &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/diego-rivera"&gt;Diego Rivera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kahlo"&gt;Frida Kahlo&lt;/a&gt;. Modotti used her photographs to advance the cause of the &lt;em&gt;campesinos&lt;/em&gt; – the mass of peasant farmers who demanded the agrarian reform they had fought for in the revolution and civil war of the previous decade. The headline of the newspaper here is a cry for fair redistribution: “All of the land, not pieces of the land!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper &lt;em&gt;El Machete&lt;/em&gt; had been founded by a group of artists and journalists under the slogan: “The machete is used to reap cane, kill snakes, end strife, and humble the pride of the impious rich.” Modotti had taken that message to heart, creating compositions like this one which conveyed, beautifully, both the unity of the &lt;em&gt;campesinos&lt;/em&gt; – individually faceless under their traditional sombreros – and their subversive collective will. By 1927 she had split from Weston and was in a relationship with a Communist party leader, Xavier Guerrero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foam.org/events/tina-modotti"&gt;Tina Modotti – Artist and Activist is at Foam, Amsterdam, 17 November–31 January 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/12/the-big-picture-faceless-campesinos-unite-in-tina-modotti-mexico"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
